                    - text: This is the best home loan calculator. i have one suggestion, for now we have only one prepayment entry addition facility but if you provide multiple prepayment options will be handy to get exact outstanding.
                    - text: e.g. i have loan of 300000.00 start from May-24 , i paid 70000.00 in Jan-2025, July-100000.00 and 350000.00 in Aug. as it outstanding will vary based on each prepayment.
